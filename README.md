# PyBer Analysis of 2019 Rideshare Data

## Overview of Analysis
The CEO of PyBer, V. Isuualize, requested an analysis of the company's ride-share data starting in January through early May of the year 2019. This data will be used to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

To help with the visualizations, this project used Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebook to the charts that are used in this analysis. The charts presented show the various relationships between city types and other data such as the number of riders, drivers, and fares.

A summary of recommendations will be presented based on the analysis.

## Results
This section first shows the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Later, a multi-line chart of total fares for each city type will be presented.

### Differences by City Type
There are 3 distinct city types included in PyBer's data: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. The datasets from these different types of cities vary greatly when comparing one against the other. This section contains several charts showing these relationships in a concise, clear manner.

TODO: add charts from completed notebook with observations.
